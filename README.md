# 02287 logical final project
This study aims to bridge the gap between theoretical game logic and practical applications by intro-
ducing a DEL-based framework tailored to the dynamics of Leduc Holdâ€™em and its expansions. Our
discussion captures the interaction between strategy, reasoning, and information flow, underpinned by
fundamental assumptions such as rationality, common knowledge, and perfect recall. We start with a
simplified model based on truthful behavior and then extend it to more complex strategies, including
deceptive tactics such as slow-play and bluffing, and model complex games with DEL, illustrating the
superiority of slow-play and bluff tactics in games and demonstrating that the use of deceptive tactics
maximizes player benefits.
